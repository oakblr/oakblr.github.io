              Humans, around the world, commute millions of miles every single

              Technology has played a very significant role in enabling more
              people to commute. Technology has fundamentally redefined the way
              we travel. Imagine how technology can improve human experience
              even further in day to day transportation and commute. What can
              technology do make public and private transportation much simpler
