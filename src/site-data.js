              Humans around the world commute millions of miles every single

              Technology has played a very significant role in enabling more
              people to commute. Technology has fundamentally redefined the way
              we travel. Imagine how technology can improve human experience
              even further in day-to-day transportation and commute. What can
              technology do to make public and private transportation much
